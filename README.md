## sample results
  * __set of optimal schedule solutions in the cost(x)-risk(y) plane; trade-off is apparent between costly minimum-risk solution (blue) and risky minimum-cost solution (orange)__

  * __minimum-cost and -variance trade trajectories for a two-security (one bought and one sold) schedule with linear impact and non-diagonal transaction and price covariances ; axes are quantity and time; minimum-variance solutions go to zero more steeply than minimum-cost solutions__
